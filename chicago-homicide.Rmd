## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:
  
```{r read}
crimes_fil<-read.csv("/Users/jessicalyu/R_HARRIS/crimes_filtered.csv")
dim(crimes_fil)
```

```{r filter}
crimes_fil%>%
  group_by(Year)%>%
  count(Year)%>%
  filter(Year>=2013 & Year<=2018)

crimes_fil<-crimes_fil%>%
  group_by(Year)%>%
  filter(Year>=2016 & Year<=2018)
dim(crimes_fil)
```

```{r convert}
crimes_fil<- st_as_sf(crimes_fil,coords = c("Longitude", "Latitude"),crs = 4326,remove=FALSE)
glimpse(crimes_fil)
plot(crimes_fil["ID"])
```
```{r load_census}
gdf<-st_read("/Users/jessicalyu/R_HARRIS/geo_export_de4e4434-d0da-4b22-97ae-b5d8724dd674.shp")
dim(gdf)
glimpse(gdf)
gdf<-rename(gdf,"geoid"="geoid10")
gdf<-select(gdf,geoid)
```

```{r spatial_join}
gdf<-st_set_crs(gdf,4326)
crimes_fil<-st_join(crimes_fil,gdf,join = st_within)
glimpse(crimes_fil)
```
```{r aggregate}
crimes_fil$geometry<- NULL
crimes_agg<-crimes_fil%>%
  group_by(geoid)%>%
  count(geoid)
glimpse(crimes_agg$n)

crimes_gdf<-gdf%>%
  left_join(crimes_agg,by = "geoid")

crimes_gdf<-mutate(crimes_gdf,n=replace_na(crimes_gdf$n,0))
glimpse(crimes_gdf)
plot(crimes_gdf["n"])
```
```{r ggplot2}

ggplot() +
  geom_sf(data = crimes_gdf, aes(color =n,fill=n) )+
  scale_color_viridis(discrete = FALSE,guide=FALSE ) +
  scale_fill_viridis(discrete = FALSE,name="homicides",direction=1 ) +
  theme_bw()+
  theme_void() +
  theme(
    panel.grid = element_line(color = "transparent")) +
  labs(
    title = "Homicides in Chicago, 2016 to Present",
    subtitle = "Data from the City of Chicago Data Portal"
  )
##potential problems:
##viridis command doesn't provide us with a clear changingof color as well as a clear distinct of homicides between different districts.
##I think the map might neglect the real population behind. A district with higher number of homicides could just has more population, then it has a lower homicide rate. Therefore, only consider the number of homicides is inappropriate for sovling problems.

```
Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
